# 📌 Project Overview
The 2020 Census introduced significant improvements in data collection, including detailed write-in options for racial and ethnic groups like White,
Black or African American, and Some Other Race. These updates enabled the tabulation of over 1,500 racial and ethnic groups—six times more than
the 2010 Census.

This enhanced data collection captures the diversity of NYC neighborhoods (NTAs) with unprecedented granularity. The census now provides counts
or detailed groups such as Congolese, Brazilian, and Middle Eastern, alongside established categories like Hispanic or Latino. It also marks the first
release of regional data for groups like Sub—Saharan African and Polynesian populations.
